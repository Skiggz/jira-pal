#Jira Pal

####Jira UI struggles enough, but even if it work it's a UI!!! #terminalftw

##Installation

* Install `node` if you do not have it
* Install `npm` if applicable
* Run `npm install jira-pal --global`

##Usage

* `jira`

##Settings

* Default settings are stored in `data/settings.js`
* To override settings you can add your own `data/settings-override.js`
  * These settings will EXTEND `data/settings.js` meaning only keys present are over written
  * Make sure your `data/settings-override.js` exports a js object with desired settings
